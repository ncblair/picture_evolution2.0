# picture_evolution2.0

## Final Product:
    User inputs a word, program 
    generates a never before seen 
    randomly incepted and evolved 
    image of that word using a 
    convolutional neural net to 
    filter images
    
## Current State:
    Generate Random Pixel Data 
    and evolve it into lighter 
    pixel data

Originally, this was a python project. To see how we implemented image evolution in python, check out my Picture_Evolution repository (See Picture_Evolution/helpers/engine.py)
